<h2 class="clipped">Readme</h2>
<p>Tabs require ARIA and JavaScript. Selecting a tab should update the visible panel <em>without</em> a full page reload. If a full page load is required, please use fake tabs instead (i.e. a simple list of links <em>styled</em> to look like tabs).</p>
<p>Use auto-selected tabs when panel content is available in DOM. Use manual-selected tabs when panel content is not available in DOM (i.e. it is fetched via AJAX).</p>

<p>Please <a href={{ "disclosure/tabs" | prepend: site.patterns_baseurl | prepend: site.patterns_url }}>read the documentation</a> to understand how these examples were created.</p>
