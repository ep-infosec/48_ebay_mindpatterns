<h1>Accessibility Patterns for the Web</h1>

<p>This site contains all working examples for the book <cite><a href="https://ebay.gitbooks.io/mindpatterns/content/">eBay MIND Patterns - Accessibility Patterns for the Web</a></cite>.</p>
<p><i>Updated: March 30th, 2022</i></p>

<hr />

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The MIND Patterns are <strong>not</strong> to be confused with a visual design system, CSS framework or JavaScript library. Our patterns are instead intended to <em>complement</em> those systems by acting as foundational accessibility guidance. We have hopefully made this fact obvious enough with our very sparse and utilitarian use of style in these examples!</p>
<p>These examples will <em>assist</em> the frontend developer with accessibility, but the source code is <strong>not</strong> considered to be final, production-ready code. Most examples leave additional steps to complete; typically any CSS styling and JavaScript behaviour that is not specifically related to core functionality or accessibility.</p>
<p>Each pattern follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a> strategy (where applicable), aims to conform to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a> Level AA, and for the most part builds on from the excellent guidance set out in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/">WCAG Authoring Practices 1.1</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Accessibility testing is performed with latest versions of:
<ul>
    <li>Edge &amp; Narrator</li>
    <li>Chrome &amp; JAWS</li>
    <li>Safari &amp; VoiceOver</li>
    <li>Firefox &amp; NVDA</li>
    <li>Chrome &amp; Chromevox</li>
</ul>

<h2>JavaScript &amp; CSS Utilities</h2>
<p>Much of the common accessibility logic in our examples comes courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/makeup/makeup-js">MakeupJS</a> - a suite of vanilla, headless UI JavaScript modules which have been created specifically for building accessible user interfaces. For example, implementing a keyboard roving tab index or dialog window modality.</p>
<p>Base styles come courtesy of <a href="https://ebay.github.io/skin">eBay Skin</a>. Skin is decoupled from the JavaScript layer, meaning the CSS is agnostic of the frontend framework. Our examples leverage Skin's custom property API, allowing a custom "theme" for our site.</p>
